__Warning:__  kokoropy is still on development stage.

<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
Ruby on Rails is a great web framework written in Ruby. 
I like how it automate things so that people can just focus on the creative things.
Python has django, pyramid and web2py which are also excellent web framework. 
In this article I'll discuss about kokoropy, a web framework based on bottle.
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

In Japanese, Kokoro means heart. Kokoropy is a web framework of my heart. 
I start to develop kokoropy on November 2012, approximately 2 years ago.

At the begining, kokoropy was highly influenced by `CodeIgniter` + `HMVC`. 
But as I know more things, kokoropy moves in it's own direction.

I believe that code should be short, simple, readable, yet explicit. 
Kokoropy's goal is to make such a thing possible.
You can download kokoropy from github repository here: 
[https://github.com/goFrendiAsgard/kokoropy](https://github.com/goFrendiAsgard/kokoropy)

After download kokoropy, you can start the server by executing this command:

```
    python rossian.py start
```

Once the server has been started, you can access `http://localhost:8080`

You can stop the server by pressing `Ctrl + C`.

rossian.py
==========

To make everything simpler, I made a management script named `rossian.py`. 
It allows you to do some crucial things like run the server, or even generate your application skeleton.
There is a sad story about the the name. Rossian is the name of my ex-girlfriend.
As she will always have a place in my heart, `rossian.py` will also have a special place in kokoropy.

Generate application
====================

Let's forget the sad story, and discuss about the fun thing.
Computer Programmers are lazy being. They hate to do the same thing over and over again. They like challenges and adventures.
Create Insert-Update-Delete things are repetitive yet crucial tasks.
It is going to be fun if we have someone (or something) do those tasks for us, and leave us with more intelligent-challenging task.

TL;DR
-----

If you don't have too much time to read, or just want to figure out what's going on in the rest of the article,
the resume is you can make a working database application without even touch the database or code anything.
Just do this:

* Make a file named `demo.txt` inside your kokoropy folder, and paste this:


```
    demo
        village
            name:String-50
            clan:clan:many-to-one
            created:DateTime
            level:Integer
            active:Boolean
            photo:Image
            friends:village:many-to-many
            commodities:resource:many-to-many:ordered
            villagers:villager:one-to-many
            important_structure:structure:one-to-many:ordered
            description:RichText
            some_code:PythonCode,
        clan
            name:String-50,
        resource
            name:String-50,
        villager
            name:String-50,
        structure
            name:String-50
```

* Generate the application by typing `python rossian.py scaffold-crud demo.txt` in your command prompt
* Run the server by typing `python rossian.py start`
* Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:8080/demo`
* You have your application, scroll down the the last section to see the generated application in action.


Define application structure
----------------------------

Kokoropy allows you to generate high-quality codes just by using some simple command.
First you need to define your database structure. Make a file named `demo.txt`, and write your database schema as follows:

```
    demo
        village
            name:String-50
            clan:clan:many-to-one
            created:DateTime
            level:Integer
            active:Boolean
            photo:Image
            friends:village:many-to-many
            commodities:resource:many-to-many:ordered
            villagers:villager:one-to-many
            important_structure:structure:one-to-many:ordered
            description:RichText
            some_code:PythonCode,
        clan
            name:String-50,
        resource
            name:String-50,
        villager
            name:String-50,
        structure
            name:String-50
```

At the first line, you define a new application named `demo`.

There will be several tables in your application:

* village
* clan
* resource
* villager
* structure

Each table definition are separated by `,`.

Next to each table definition, there are field definitions of the respective table.

Take a look at this part:

```
    (...)
    structure
        name:String-50
```

It means that `structure` table has a column named `name` which is `String`. The size of the column is `50`.
Pretty simple right? There are some column type recognized by the generator:

* String
* Integer
* Float
* Date
* DateTime
* Boolean
* Text
* Upload
* Image
* RichTex
* HTMLCode
* PythonCode
* JSCode

Beside those column types, you can also define relationship with other table.
Relationship has `field-name:other-table:relation-type` format. 
You can add `:ordered` for many-to-many and one-to-many relation if row order does matter.

For example, look at this:

```
    village
        (...)
        clan:clan:many-to-one
        commodities:resource:many-to-many:ordered
        villagers:villager:one-to-many
```

`village` table has `many-to-one` relationship with `clan` table.
This means that a village is belong to just a clan, while a clan can has several villages.

`village` table has `many-to-many` relationship with `commodities` table.
This means that that a village can has many resource as their commodity. 
However the same resource can be owned by several villages as their commodity.
The `:ordered` is also added to the relationship definition. This means that commodities order does matter.

`village` table also has one-to-many relationship with `villager` table.
This means that a villager is only belong to one village, while a village can has several villagers.


Generate the application
------------------------

To generate the application, you just need to execute this command:

```
    rossian.py scaffold-crud demo.txt
```

`rossian.py` will make a `application/demo` folder for you. Let's peek a bit.

{% img /images/kokoropy-structure.png %}


The simplest generated models is `applications/demo/models/clan.py`. The content is as follows:

```
    from kokoropy.model import DB_Model, Ordered_DB_Model, or_, and_, Column, ForeignKey, func, relationship,\
        backref, association_proxy, creator_maker, fk_column, one_to_many, many_to_one, lookup_proxy,\
        Integer, Float, String, Date, DateTime, Boolean, Text, Upload, Option, RichText, Code
    from _config import session, metadata

    DB_Model.metadata = metadata

    class Clan(DB_Model):
        __session__          = session
        # Fields Declarations
        name                 = Column(String(50))
```

Pretty straight forward, you have a `Clan` class with `name` property which is a column.

Village models is a bit more complex since it has a lot of relationship with other tables.
This is the content of `applications/demo/models/village.py`:

```
    from kokoropy.model import DB_Model, Ordered_DB_Model, or_, and_, Column, ForeignKey, func, relationship,\
        backref, association_proxy, creator_maker, fk_column, one_to_many, many_to_one, lookup_proxy,\
        Integer, Float, String, Date, DateTime, Boolean, Text, Upload, Option, RichText, Code
    from _config import session, metadata

    DB_Model.metadata = metadata

    class Village(DB_Model):
        __session__          = session
        # Excluded Columns
        __detail_excluded_shown_column__ = {
                "village_friends" : ["left_village"],
                "village_commodities" : ["village"]
            }
        __detail_excluded_form_column__ = {
                "village_friends" : ["left_village"],
                "village_commodities" : ["village"]
            }
        # Column's Labels
        __column_label__ = {
                "village_friends" : "Friends",
                "village_commodities" : "Commodities"
            }
        # Detail Column's Labels
        __detail_column_label__ = {
                "village_friends" : {
                    "right_village" : "Village"
                }
            }
        # Fields Declarations
        name                 = Column(String(50))
        fk_clan              = fk_column("clan._real_id")
        clan                 = many_to_one("Clan", "Village.fk_clan")
        created              = Column(DateTime)
        level                = Column(Integer)
        active               = Column(Boolean)
        photo                = Column(Upload(is_image=True))
        village_friends      = one_to_many("Village_Friends", "Village_Friends.fk_left_village")
        friends              = lookup_proxy("village_friends", "Village_Friends.right_village")
        village_commodities  = one_to_many("Village_Commodities", "Village_Commodities.fk_village")
        commodities          = lookup_proxy("village_commodities", "Village_Commodities.resource")
        villagers            = one_to_many("Villager", "Villager.fk_village")
        important_structure  = one_to_many("Structure", "Structure.fk_village")
        description          = Column(RichText)
        some_code            = Column(Code(language="python"))

    class Village_Friends(DB_Model):
        __session__          = session
        # Fields Declarations
        fk_left_village      = fk_column("village._real_id")
        fk_right_village     = fk_column("village._real_id")
        left_village         = many_to_one("Village", "Village_Friends.fk_left_village")
        right_village        = many_to_one("Village", "Village_Friends.fk_right_village")

    class Village_Commodities(Ordered_DB_Model):
        __session__          = session
        # Fields Declarations
        fk_village           = fk_column("village._real_id")
        fk_resource          = fk_column("resource._real_id")
        village              = many_to_one("Village", "Village_Commodities.fk_village")
        resource             = many_to_one("Resource", "Village_Commodities.fk_resource")

```
If you are familiar with `sqlalchemy`, you can see that the syntax is a bit shorter since I have make some shortcut.
For example `fk_column("village._real_id")` is a shortcut for `Column(Integer, foreign_keys="village._real_id")`.

`__detail_excluded_shown_column__` and other properties started with double-underscore are used to deal with presentation of `one-to-many` relationship field.


Now let's see at the controller. The controller's code is very simple. For example, look at `applications/demo/controllers/clan.py`

```
    from kokoropy.controller import Crud_Controller
    from ..models._all import Clan

    class Clan_Controller(Crud_Controller):
        __model__       = Clan

    Clan_Controller.publish_route()
```

Lastly, let's see at the view. All of views generated will use `applications/demo/views/base.html` as their base.
So, if you want to change the header or footer of all views, this is the file to be edited.

```
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <link rel="shortcut icon" href="{{BASE_URL}}index/assets/favicon.ico" />
            <meta charset="utf-8">
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
            <meta name="description" content="{{ get('_description', 'A web page') }}">
            <meta name="author" content="{{ get('_author', 'You') }}">
            {{ !JQUI_BOOTSTRAP_STYLE }}
            <title>{{ get('_title', 'Your Application') }}</title>
            {% block style %}{% endblock %}
        </head>
        <body>
            <div class="container" role="main">
                <div class="header">
                    <h1>Your Application Title</h1>
                </div>
                <!-- content -->
                <div  id="layout-content">
                    {{ !base }}
                    {% block content %}No content{% endblock %}
                </div>

                <!-- footer -->
                <div class="footer">
                  <p>&copy; Yourself</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            {{ !JQUI_BOOTSTRAP_SCRIPT }}
            {% block script %}{% endblock %}
        </body>
    </html>
```



`rossian.py` doesn't generate per-table views for you. However, if you want to change the view of any of your table, you can do `python rossian.py scaffold-view APPLICATION-NAME table-name [view]`
Replace `[view]` with one of these verbs:

* create
* delete
* destroy
* edit
* list
* new
* remove
* search
* show
* trash
* untrash
* update

or leave it blank to let `rossian.py` scaffold all the views.

For example, `python rossian.py scaffold-view demo clan show` will make `rossian.py` create `applications/demo/views/clan/show.html`
which such a content:

```
    % rebase('demo/views/base') if base_view is None else rebase(base_view)
    % if clan is not None:
    %   clan.generate_detail_view()
    % end

    {% block style %}
        % if clan is not None:
            {{! clan.generated_css.compiled }}
        % end
    {% endblock %}

    {% block script %}
        % if clan is not None:
            {{! clan.generated_js.compiled }}
        % end
    {% endblock %}

    {% block content %}
        % if clan is not None:
            <h4>Showing {{ caption }} : {{! clan.as_text() }}</h4>
            {{! clan.generated_html }}
            <div>
                % if not clan.trashed:
                    <a class="btn btn-default" href="{{ url_list["edit"] }}/{{ clan.id }}">
                        <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil"></i> Edit clan
                    </a>
                    <a href="{{ url_list['list'] }}" class="btn btn-default">
                        <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-th"></i> Back to List
                    </a>
                % else:
                    <a href="{{ url_list['list'] }}?trash=1" class="btn btn-default">
                        <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-th"></i> Back to List
                    </a>
                % end
            </div>
        % else:
            <div class="alert alert-danger">Data not found</div>
        % end
    {% endblock %}
```
