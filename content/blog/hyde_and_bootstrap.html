Just moving to github.io

Github provide a very good platform to have your own static page. Using static page means that you don't need to think about:

* database
* server setting
* security

However, write a static page also means that you need to code the banner, links etc repetitively.
Fortunately, we have hyde (github recommend jekyll, but I am a Python guy). By using hyde, you can enjoy the advantage of jinja template.

As a boiler-plate, I use [hyde-bootstrap](https://github.com/auzigog/hyde-bootstrap) which was created by auzigog.
It is quiete intuitive and pretty easy to follow.

I can't wait to hack around, look for any possibility to make this website cooler.
Right now, I've just add disqus to every post in my blog. This is cool :)
